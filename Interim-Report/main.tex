\chapter{Introduction}
MRI is very suited to imaging the developing fetus due to its impressive contrast and lack of harmful side effects. However, limitations in resolution make imaging what can often be a very small target volume difficult. Super resolution is a technique to mitigate this that constructs a higher resolution image from many lower resolution images. Unfortunately super resolution introduces some uncertainty which may not be obvious from looking at the reconstructed image.
