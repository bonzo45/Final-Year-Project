<h1>MRI Orientation Notes</h1>
<p>The mri_toolbox download at 
<a href="http://eeg.sourceforge.net">http://eeg.sourceforge.net</a>
contains matlab code that employs the orient header field to read and 
orthotransform ANALYZE volumes (see the avw* functions).  In this code 
you will find complete documentation of the XYZ directions for all 
6 orthogonal orientations (see avw_img_read.m).</p>

<p>The default ANALYZE orientation is LAS, +X is <u>L</u>eft, +Y is <u>A</u>nterior, 
+Z is <u>S</u>uperior.  This corresponds to avw.hdr.hist.orient=0, transverse unflipped.
This is the radiological orientation.  The neurological convention is RAS, so 
the direction of X is swapped.  The standard analyze format does not support
this orientation in the hdr.hist.orient field.</p>

<p>This toolbox will try to load an Analyze volume as an LAS volume, so
long as the avw.hdr.hist.orient field is set correctly.  Thus, the avw_view
function should always present the volume in LAS (radiological) orientation (a
GUI control allows easy flipping for viewing purposes).  If you need to, there
you can use avw_flip to orthoflip any dimension, although this could easily
invalidate the Analyze coordinate system.</p>

<p>The avw.hdr.hist.orient field is "optional" and not all software will read
or write it correctly.  For example, <a href="http://www.sensor.com">MEDx</a>
will set an unused header field.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the flipped orientations (orient values 3-5) are only defined in
Analyze to support a movie animation.  The flipping is not done in the slice
direction, but rather in the dimension that suits raster graphics.  The flipping
has NO relationship to the actual orientation of the volume, only to how the data
is handled during graphics processes.  Thus, orient values 3-5 are NOT RECOMMENDED.
For example, for a transverse LAS volume, the orient=3 option flips to the 
anterior-posterior direction (LPS), which does not provide for saving RAS 
volumes.  Nevertheless, this toolbox will attempt to handle the flipped Analyze
volumes correctly.</p>

<p>If your not sure what the orientation of a volume is, it is near impossible
to differentiate LAS from RAS without landmarks in the image.  A useful tool is
the flip L/R control in avw_view.  It will allow you to quickly flip left/right
to find visual cues that differentiate these two orientations.  Some high 
resolution T1 anatomical data I have worked with was acquired with a small 
pinpoint artifact in the central voxel of the left most slice of the volume 
(what a great idea! except when it comes to intensity normalisation!).  It's
also possible to use radiological markers (a preferable method, perhaps, as it
should avoid the above intensity artifact when normalising or correcting Bo field 
distortions).  If that information is not available to you, but you have the
original scanner files, you can try to use <a href="http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net">
http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net</a> to read the original scanner volume headers, 
which usually contain useful orientation information, if you can interpret it
(maybe speak to your radiographer).  You might then use (X)medcon to convert
the original data to ANALYZE, in a specific orientation.  Keep careful track
of how the orientation, especially left/right changes during this
conversion.  Also consider acquisition of a small phantom volume, containing
RAS orientation markers, in the sequence you use for your subject data.  You
can then process that volume through all the stages of your analyses to
confirm what the final result orientation is.</p>

<p>All the best getting it right.  The orientation issue has been a real issue
for me, hence the development of the tools.  After better understanding how 
it all works, the anxiety starts to dissipate ;-)  It's frustrating that our 
visuo-spatial intelligence for 3D object orientation virtually goes 
out the window when looking at ortho slices!  In reality, we know this 
is a simple problem, yet the ortho views are unyielding!</p>
