% EMSE_MRI2ELEC: Convert mri coordinates to points in head frame

% [Velec] = emse_mri2elec(vert,reg)
% 
% vert   - the Nx3 (X,Y,Z) MRI coordinates to be converted
% reg    - a structure containing coordinate transform matrices,
%          which is read using emse_open_reg
% 
% Given a point P(x,y,z) in MRI frame (eg, an fMRI activation 
% overlayed onto a high res T1 volume) this function will find 
% the corresponding location in the head space of the electrodes.
% Symbolically we have P(voxel) and want to find P(head).
% 
% 1.  Use the offset between the MRI coordinate frame and 
%     the MRI volume coordinate frame to find P(MRI-voxel).
% 2.  Given P(MRI-voxel) and the voxel size, we can find 
%     P(MRI-mm), which is the MRI coordinates expressed in mm
% 3.  The registration file contains the matrix ImageToHeadMatrix,
%     so P(head) = P(MRI-mm)*reg.mri2elec, where P(MRI-mm) is the 
%     point in MRI coordinates.
% 
% This function performs the last calculation.
