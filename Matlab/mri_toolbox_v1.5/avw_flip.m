% AVW_FLIP: ortho-flip Analyze data image (avw.img)
% 
% [ avw ] = avw_flip(avw,dims)
% 
% where avw is the data struct returned from avw_img_read
% and dims is a cell array of strings, eg: dims = {'x','y','z'}
% with any number of cells, in any order.
% 
% For each cell of dims, the dimension of avw.img is flipped, 
% independently of all other dimensions and the order in which
% they are specified.  There are no 3D rotations, which are 
% not orthogonal flips.
% 
% This function will most likely invalidate the .img orientation, 
% so use it carefully.  There is no attempt in this function
% to maintain the validity of the avw.hdr.hist.orient field.
