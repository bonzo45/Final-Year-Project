To evaluate the project researchers at both Imperial College London and Kings College London have been consulted for feedback. Each part of the plugin has been evaluated separately.

\section{Scan Simulation}
For the scan simulation part of the project feedback from the users was needed firstly on whether this was a useful feature for them. If it was, then limitations of the current implementation needed to be found - in particular are there any parameters that they would expect to be able to control that aren't available or are there some more advanced MRI scanning artefacts that need simulating.

The potential users were asked ''?

<graph of is this useful>

Did they think it was useful?

The users were then asked ''?

They said x, y, z.

Then came the question on realism which provoked the largest response. As it turns out there are many things that researchers would like to see integrated. Here they are <insert here>

This raises the question of how much realism needs to be simulated to effectively test reconstruction algorithms. Highly realistic MRI simulation has been done before and tools, such as MRiLab\cite{mrilab}, allow the user to experiment with different scan sequences, coils and more. Whether this level of detail is needed to accurately test a reconstruction algorithm requires more research to find out.

\section{Reconstruction}
Opinion. Landmarks. Time to do it. Feedback. Different feedback from different points of view.

\section{Visualization}
Three things. Understand. Clear. Configurable.

% General Format -> What we wanted to find out. Go through each question. For those that are quantitative give us a graph. For those that aren't then talk about What they said.
